# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I think it went pretty well in general. The formatting of object literals exercise was a little bit unclear to me intially, but I think I figured it out. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It's been going well. I've been using Bear and it seems to keep me organized. 
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I enjoy pair programming. It helps clarify my understanding of the topic.
